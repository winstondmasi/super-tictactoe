# Rules of "Super Tic Tac Toe":

1. The game consists of a 3x3 grid of tic-tac-toe boards, making a total of 81 spaces.
2. The first player (X) can play in any of these 81 spaces.
3. The chosen square by a player in a smaller tic-tac-toe board determines the board in which the next player must play. For example, if player X plays in the middle square of the upper right board, then player O must play anywhere in the middle board.
4. If a player gets 3 in a row in one of the smaller games, that entire square is marked for the player who won it.
5. If a player is forced to play in a square that has already been won, they can instead choose to play anywhere.
6. The game continues until a player wins by having three smaller boards in a row marked in their favor.
